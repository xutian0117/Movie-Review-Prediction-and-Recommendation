# Investigating the Temporal Dynamics of Online Movie Reviews: A Multi-Model Approach to Sentiment Prediction and Reviewer Behavior

## Overview

This project explores the temporal dynamics of online movie reviews by employing multiple machine learning models to predict sentiment and understand reviewer behavior. By analyzing how sentiments and behaviors change over time, this study provides valuable insights for movie producers, marketers, and reviewers to better understand and respond to audience feedback.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the review text for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical features.
- **Sentiment Prediction**: Implements multiple models to predict the sentiment of reviews.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Investigates how sentiments and reviewer behavior change over time.




## Usage
Data Loading: The notebook starts by mounting Google Drive to access the dataset. Ensure your data is stored in your Google Drive or modify the data loading section to match your data source.

- **Text Preprocessing**: The text data is cleaned by removing punctuation, stopwords, and applying stemming.

- **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorizer is used to transform the textual data into numerical features.

- **Model Implementation**: Various models are applied to predict sentiment, including:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Neural Networks

- **Temporal Analysis**: The notebook includes methods to analyze sentiment trends and reviewer behavior over different time periods.

## Implications
For Movie Producers and Marketers
Understanding the temporal dynamics of movie reviews can help producers and marketers identify patterns in audience feedback. This can be crucial for:

- **Marketing Campaigns**: Tailoring marketing strategies based on sentiment trends over time.
- **Release Strategies**: Timing movie releases to maximize positive audience reception.
- **Content Creation**: Creating content that resonates more with the audience by understanding their evolving preferences.
  
## For Reviewers and Critics
